                                Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy”,is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates.He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew and closest friends).He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Sabo.However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks.

                                            Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
